# RedditBot

This Github Repository contains my submission for project 4.  A link to project instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/mikeizbicki/cmc-csci040/tree/2022fall/project_04#submission).  My bot is opposing Donald Trump, and supporting Joe Biden via upvotes in my `bot_vote.py` file.

Here is a [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/cs40_2022fall/comments/ywivox/comment/ixa6rl6/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) to my favorite thread involving my bot.  Attached below is a screenshot of the thread: ![selected favorite thread](https://github.com/jadersaunders/RedditBot/blob/main/favorite_bot_thread.png)

I like this thread because you can see my bot interacting with other bots, and trying to reply and continue the conversation.  The thread makes some sense, and I also like how you can see my madlibs text and Markovify text being posted simultaneously.

Included below is the output of running my `bot_counter.py` file on my bot llamabot45, which generated over 1000 valid comments.

## Completed Tasks 
1. 12 points: all tasks in `bot.py`
2. 3 points: this Github repo 
3. 10 points: getting 1000+ valid comments (in the output of my `bot_counter.py` file)
4. 2 points: the `bot_submissions.py file` - having my bot create 200+ submission posts.  I scanned the top posts in the subreddits /r/TrumpCriticizesTrump/, /r/Trumpvirus/, /r/TrumpHatesTheTroops/ and /r/america/.
5. 2 points: having my bot reply to highly upvoted comments in thread with code in my `bot.py` file below the `comments_without_replies` function.
6. 4 points: having my bot upvote comments mentioning biden in my `bot_vote.py` file.  I earned an extra 2 points here because I used TextBlob to determine the sentiment of posts, and upvoted/downvoted based on the sentiment.  I ran on at least 100 submissions and all comments in those submissions.
7. 5 points: using Markovify to generate the text of my comments - I have uploaded my 3 text files `trumptext.txt`, `trumptext2.txt`, `trumptext3.txt`

###### Not completed: 
1. 2 points: creating an army of 5 bots

As a result, I think my final score should be a 38/30.
